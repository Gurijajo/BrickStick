        <p>Through our experience, we've noticed a common trend in property listings, especially with the front-of-house photos. 
            Often, these pictures are taken from a distance to avoid highlighting any disrepair or moss growth on stairs or walkways.
            By offering small masonry repairs and oxicleaning services, we consistently deliver results that impress buyers, sellers, and listing agents alike.</p>
